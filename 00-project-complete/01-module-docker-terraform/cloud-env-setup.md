# Cloud-Based Environment Setup

- Learning in public [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anjcalleja_techproject-gcp-cloud-activity-7163127536321826816-jdzi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

**Objective:**
Setting up of a comprehensive environment on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine (VM)

**Project Steps:**

1. **Create Google Cloud Platform Account:**
   - [x] Register a new email address dedicated to this project to obtain €300 in Google 
   - [x] Create an account for Google Cloud Platform. 

2. **Log in to GCP:**
   - [x] Access the Google Cloud Platform through a web browser and log in to the newly created account.

3. **Project Initialization:**
   - [x] Create a new GCP project to organize your resources efficiently.
   - [x] For this specific project I named it "data-engineering"

4. **Budget Management:**
   - [x] Set up a Google Cloud budget to monitor and control your project expenses.

5. **SSH Key Generation:**
   - [x] Open your local machine terminal/powershell
   - [x] Generate SSH keys for secure communication between your local machine and the GCP VM.
   - [x] Refer to the documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/create-ssh-keys#rest) for creating an SSH key pair for Compute Engine VM instances using the command: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME -C USERNAME -b 2048`.

6. **Virtual Machine Creation:**
   - [x] Deploy a virtual machine on GCP configured to host the development environment.
   - [x] VM details: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-1048-gcp x86_64)

7. **SSH Connection Setup:**
   - [x] Save Your Public SSH Key to Clipboard.
   - [x] Add SSH Key to GCP Compute Engine: Navigate to GCP: Menu -> Compute Engine -> Metadata -> SSH Keys.
   - [x] Click "Add SSH Key" and paste your public SSH key.
   - [x] Connect to GCP VM using SSH:
   - Go to your terminal/powershell and use this command: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/<private-ssh-key-filename> <GCP-account-name>@<VM-External-IP>`. Ensure to replace <private-ssh-key-filename>, <GCP-account-name>, and <VM-External-IP> with your specific values
   - [x] Confirm the connection when prompted:

```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
```

   - [x] Successful connection results in a welcome message displaying system information.
```

- [x] Use `htop` for System Monitoring: a command-line tool used to monitor and manage the processes running on a computer. It provides a visual representation of the system's resources, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and more. htop allows you to see which processes are using the most resources and gives you the ability to interactively manage them, such as killing a process if needed.
- [x] Initial Check with `ls`: Upon the first ls command, confirm that the VM file system is empty. Validate the absence of any pre-existing files or directories.
- [x] Execute the command `gcloud --version` to verify the Google Cloud SDK version.

installation finished.
Do you wish to update your shell profile to automatically initialize conda?
This will activate conda on startup and change the command prompt when activated.
If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
   run the following command when conda is activated:

conda config --set auto_activate_base false

You can undo this by running `conda init --reverse $SHELL`? [yes|no]
[no] >>> yes

==> For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell. <==

Thank you for installing Anaconda3!

```  


   - [x] Use `ls` command to confirm, it should appear

    - [x] Install remote-ssh
    - [x] At the lower left corner of your VSCode there is a button similar to this ><. Click Open a Remote Window
    - [x] Click "connect to host" -> choose your <VMName>
    - [x] Go to VSCode terminal and do `ls`, it will confirm that you are on your VM.      
    - [x] And have access the remote machine using Visual Studio Code and SSH remote connection.

12. **Docker Compose Installation:**
    - [x] Install docker-compose for managing multi-container Docker applications.

13. **Database Interaction:**
- [x] Install pgcli for PostgreSQL interaction.

`docker ps`
Go to the file where "docker-compose.yaml" is, then run:
`docker-compose-linux-x86_64 up -d`
`docker ps`
It will look like this
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS                                            NAMES

```

- [x] Run PostgreSQL using pip**

```
pip install pgcli
```

- [x] Connect to the PostgreSQL using: 
```
pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxi
```

Sample Output:
```

```

- Let's uninstall pgcli to try another way to run PostgreSQL using anaconda 
`pip uninstall pgcli`

- [x] Run PostgreSQL using anaconda**

`conda install -c conda-forge pgcli`
`pip install --upgrade pgcli`
`pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxi`

```

    - [x] Click "Forward a Port"
    - [x] Type 5432 for pgadmin and go to the forwarded address
    - [x] Type 8080 for jupyter notebook and go to the forwarded address
    - [x] Go back to terminal and run: `jupyter notebook`
    - [x] On your repo go to where your "upload-data.ipynb" Python script is and run the code.
    - [x] Configure port-forwarding in Visual Studio Code to connect to pgAdmin and Jupyter from your local machine.


15. Uploading Data to PostgresSQL
    - [x] Run `wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz` where your upload-data.ipynb is

`pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxi`

```

Goodbye!

```


16. Secure File Transfer
    - [x] Utilize `sftp` for securely transferring credentials to the remote machine.

    - [x] Download GCP Service account <GCP ProjectName>.json file:
```
Create a service account and obtain the credentials (JSON key file) for Google Cloud in the context of using Terraform

1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console:
Open the Google Cloud Console.

2. Select or Create a Project:
Ensure that you are working within the correct project or create a new one.

3. Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service accounts:
In the left sidebar, go to "IAM & Admin" and then click on "Service accounts."

4. Create a Service Account:

Click on the "Create Service Account" button.
Provide a name and description for the service account.
Choose the appropriate role(s) that grant the necessary permissions for your Terraform operations. You might need roles like Editor or more specific roles depending on your use case.

5. Create a Key and Download JSON File:
After creating the service account, click on the service account's name.
Go to the "Keys" tab.
Click on the "Add Key" button and choose "JSON" as the key type.
This will download a JSON file containing the service account key to your local machine.


6. Set Environment Variable:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to point to the location of the downloaded JSON key file. This step is crucial for Terraform to use the correct credentials.

`export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.gc/<GCP ProjectName>`
`gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
```

 - [x] Go back to terminal of your local machine
`sftp <VMName>`

```
Connected to <VMName>.
sftp> ls
Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh     Anaconda3-2023.09-0-MacOSX-arm64.sh     
anaconda3                               bin                                     
<repoName                               snap                                    
sftp> mkdir .gc
sftp> cd .gc
sftp> ls
sftp> put <GCP ProjectName>.json
Uploading <GCP ProjectName>.json to /home/.gc/<GCP ProjectName>.json
<GCP ProjectName>.json     100% 2411   123.8KB/s   00:00    
sftp> Connection to <External IP> closed by remote host.
```

`ssh <VMName>`
`cd .gc/`
```
$ ls
<GCP ProjectName>.json
```

## Optional: From here you can iterate the infrastrature using Terraform

17. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

    - [x] Install Terraform for automated infrastructure provisioning and management.

`cd bin`
`wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.7.0/terraform_1.7.0_linux_amd64.zip`
`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install unzip`
`unzip terraform_1.7.0_linux_amd64.zip`
`rm terraform_1.7.0_linux_amd64.zip`


Configure your main.tf and variables.tf
`cd <reponame>/<terraform folder>`
`code <terraform folder>`




- [x] Configure Terraform files (main.tf, variables.tf) for your project.
- [x] Run Terraform commands to initialize, plan, and apply infrastructure changes.

`terraform init`
`terraform plan`
`terraform apply`


18. **Environment Cleanup:**
    - [x] Learn the process of shutting down and removing the GCP VM instance to manage resources effectively.
