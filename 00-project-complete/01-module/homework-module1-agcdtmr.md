## Docker & SQL

In this homework we'll prepare the environment 
and practice with Docker and SQL


## Question 1. Knowing docker tags

Run the command to get information on Docker 

```docker --help```

Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command:

```docker build --help```

Do the same for "docker run".

Which tag has the following text? - *Automatically remove the container when it exits* 

- `--delete`
- `--rc`
- `--rmc`
- `--rm` x


## Question 2. Understanding docker first run 

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.
Now check the python modules that are installed ( use ```pip list``` ). 

What is version of the package *wheel* ?

- 0.42.0 x
- 1.0.0
- 23.0.1
- 58.1.0

```
% docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash python:3.9

# Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos
We'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:

```wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv```

Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)

```
pip install psycopg2-binary pandas
```


## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18. 

Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

- 15767
- 15612 x
- 15859
- 89009

```
To count the number of taxi trips that were made on September 18th, 2019, you can execute a SQL query on your PostgreSQL database. Assuming you have a column named lpep_pickup_datetime for pickup timestamps and lpep_dropoff_datetime for dropoff timestamps in your green_tripdata table, you can use the following query:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM green_tripdata 
WHERE DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-09-18' AND DATE(lpep_dropoff_datetime) = '2019-09-18';
This query filters records where both the pickup and dropoff dates are equal to September 18th, 2019. The result will be the total number of taxi trips made on that day.

You can execute this query in pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client connected to your database. After running the query, you will get the count, and you can compare it with the provided options (15767, 15612, 15859, 89009) to find the correct answer.
```



## Question 4. Largest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2019-09-18
- 2019-09-16
- 2019-09-26 x
- 2019-09-21

```
To find the pick-up day with the largest trip distance for each specified date, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the date and the maximum trip distance for each date:

SELECT
  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) AS pickup_day,
  MAX(trip_distance) AS max_trip_distance
FROM
  green_tripdata
WHERE
  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) IN ('2019-09-18', '2019-09-16', '2019-09-26', '2019-09-21')
GROUP BY
  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime);

This query extracts the date from the `lpep_pickup_datetime` column, filters for the specified dates, calculates the maximum trip distance for each date, and groups the results by the pick-up day.

Execute this query in your PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client. The result will show the pick-up day along with the largest trip distance for each of the specified dates.
```


## Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs

Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?
 
- "Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"
- "Bronx" "Brooklyn" "Manhattan"
- "Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens" 
- "Brooklyn" "Queens" "Staten Island"


## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's `tip` , not `trip`

- Central Park
- Jamaica
- JFK Airport
- Long Island City/Queens Plaza



## Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform. 
Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/01-docker-terraform/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 7. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.
```
terraform apply  

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "demo_dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
      + dataset_id                 = "demo_dataset_annnn"

    }

      + terraform_labels            = (known after apply)
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = (known after apply)
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type = "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload"
            }
          + condition {
              + age                   = 1
              + matches_prefix        = []
              + matches_storage_class = []
              + matches_suffix        = []
              + with_state            = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
